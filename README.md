# Event-Scheduler
The project is an prototype for an all-purpose scheduler software. The scheduler will be designed to monitor all the activities and give appropriate reminders for them, may they be class/work meetings or upcoming birthdays. It will also have a note feature so the user can jot down their thoughts and any important information on the spot. It will also take into account the user's health and give meaningful pop-ups for meals, prompting the user to exercise after long hours of sitting and to stay hydrated.

Fork this repository and run the scheduler locally to access the features of this scheduler.
